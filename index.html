    	We put the <script> tag at the bottom for two reasons.
        1. When the browser hits a <script> tag it will delay rendering the page, 
           so for usability, if we put our <scripts> at the end of the page; it will render faster
        2. If the Javascript is executed in the <head> the <body>  won't be rendered yet
           so we won't be able to manipulate our HTML
